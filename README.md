# Reimplementation from scatch of YOLOv8 for Car Detection

In this project, we re-implement the architecture proposed in the paper [Real-Time Flying Object Detection with YOLOv8](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09972), adapting it specifically for car detection in images.

## Project description
The original paper proposed the new architecture of YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for Real-Tie Flyinig Object Detection. We have reimplemented the same structure from scratch
